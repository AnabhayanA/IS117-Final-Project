## 💬 PRESENTING TO PROFESSOR

**If You Present First (2-3 minutes):**

"Hi Professor, I'm Anabhayan. My final project is a multi-site portfolio system with 4 interconnected websites.

[Open landing page on projector]

You can see the landing hub here - I went with a dark mocha theme for warmth. 

[Click through each site]

The personal portfolio has an Astroworld-inspired theme - bold yellows and purples with animated gradients. The design style guide showcases Material Design 3 with purple and teal. And the client site is a professional tech startup with clean blues.

[Show one animation]

Each site has scroll-triggered animations using Intersection Observer API, parallax effects, and responsive hamburger menus. All built with vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks.

[Mention stats]

33 Git commits showing iterative development, comprehensive documentation including a full presentation deck, and all sites score 90+ on Lighthouse audits.

[Show on mobile]

Everything's fully responsive - you can see the hamburger menu here on mobile view.

All code is on GitHub and deployed via GitHub Pages. Thank you!"
